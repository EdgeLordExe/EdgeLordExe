Hi! My name is Edge! I'm an aspriring Software Developer, that is fascinated by ML.

Tho i didn't do (any) ML stuff (brain too small for now), i did some amount of game development and compiler development. 
While to be frank some concepts do overwhelm me, I'm a very quick learner. 

Fun facts:
- documenting code at 3 am when english is your second language will most likely end in a massive disaster!
- brain smoothe
- Free speech advocate, anarchist and critic of all establishments
- Did you know war on drugs was started because Nixon didn't want blacks and hippies to vote so he outlawed their drug of choice.
